Arbitrary Binary Functions
===

Shannon's counting argument.

$$
x \in \mathbb{B}^n \\\\
 \\\\
f(X): \\{0,1\\}^n \mapsto \\{0,1\\}
$$

There are $2^{2^n}$ different binary functions.
Can we approximate this with less than $\frac{2^n}{c n}$ boolean gates for some constant $c$?

The strategy to show we can't is to overcount the number of boolean gates.

$$
\begin{align}
 m & & \text{ boolean gates } (\frac{2^n}{c n}) \\\\
 n & & \text{ inputs }
\end{align}
$$

Label each of the $m$ gates as either one of the $n$ inputs or one of the set of $\{ \wedge, \vee, \neg \}$.
Assume a maximum of 2 inputs but that outputs can be traced to as many other gates as needed.

We have a total of $(n+3)$ labels for each gate and a maximum of $m^2$ input choices.

Each of the $m$ gates has a choice of label and choice of inputs, giving:


$$
 ((n + 3) m^2)^m 
$$

$$
\lg = \log_2
$$

For $n$ large enough:

$$
\begin{align}
 \lg( ((n + 3) m^2)^m ) & = \frac{2^n}{c n} [ \lg(n+3) + 2 n - 2 \lg(c n) ] \\\\
 = \frac{2^n}{c} [ \frac{\lg(n+3)}{n} + 2 - \frac{2 \lg(c n)}{n} ] & < \frac{2^n}{c} [ \frac{2 \lg(n)}{n} + 2 - \frac{2 \lg(c n)}{n} ] \\\\
 = \frac{2^n}{c} [ 2 + \frac{2}{n} ( \lg(n) - \lg(n) - \lg(c) ) ]  & = \frac{2^n}{c} [ 2 - \frac{2}{n} \lg(c) ] \\\\
 < 2 \frac{ 2^n }{ c } & = \frac{2^n}{ \frac{c}{2} }
\end{align}
$$

For $c>2$:

$$
 ((n + 3) m^2)^m < 2^{2^n}
$$

Even when we overcount, we still can't the count large enough to represent all binary functions.
