Notes on "The Gervais Principle"
===

**NOTE**: The items on this page are my interpretation of what the Ribbon Farm site is talking about, not
my opinions.
Everything below should be read with a "this is the argument that Ribbon Farm is presenting" prefix.
I disagree with many points below but I'm presenting them here to collect my thoughts about what the
argument is.

[The Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/):

> Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing
> losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths,
> and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves

Here, "loser" is in the economic sense of the word, in that they are giving more value
to the company than they are extracting from it.

I will try to refer to them as "economic loser" to try and disentangle the alternate social
connotation of "loser".

Some points:

* This creates a pyramid with 'sociopaths' at the top, the 'clueless' in the middle and 'economic losers' at the bottom
* The 'clueless' act as a kind of buffer to the 'sociopaths' to shield them from risk
* 'Sociopaths' at the beginning of an organization, recruits the 'economic losers' to build out the business idea and then,
  later in the lifecycle of the business, start making decisions, perhaps about mergers, cuts or layoffs, to maximize
  profit that other people are too compassionate or unaware to pursue
* Underperforming economic losers that do not have 'sociopathic' ambitions are fired

---

There is a matrix of transition that can be created:

| "From" state \ "To" state | Unaffiliated | Economic Loser | Clueless | Sociopath |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unaffiliated |  n/a | Entry level position | Result of merger/acquisition or leverage from another position | Result of merger/acquisition |
| Economic Loser | Under performing "economic loser" with no "sociopathic" ambitions ("incompetent under performing economic loser") | Bare minimum performing "economic loser" | Over performing "economic loser" | Under performing "economic loser" with "sociopathic" ambitions |
| Clueless | Let go to shield a higher ranking "sociopath"  | Demoted to shield higher ranking "sociopath"  | Steady state | n/a |
| Sociopath | Left because of lack of profitability or exited because of a failed power play | Punitive measure or n/a | Punitive measure or n/a | Steady state  |

* The nature of promoting under performing "economic losers" to "sociopath" positions is a near necessity, as energy
  needs to be devoted for sociopathic ambitions
* A weaker argument might be that "economic losers" that under perform but have "sociopath" ambitions are signalling
  that they want the desired position
* Sociopaths are a near requirement to keep the business sustainable/profitable as their emotional detachment allows
  them to make decisions that keep the business profitable, sustainable or alive (sometimes at the expense of
  creating a moral hazard in other ways)


Economic Losers
---

These are four states of the economic losers:

* Underperforming with no sociopathic ambitions
  - The exit path is being fired
* Underperforming with sociopathic ambitions
  - Underperformance is not sustainable so if they aren't promoted, they are fired
* Bare-minimum performing
  - The vast majority of people (bottom of the pyramid)
  - Have made a trade of security for lack of career power or career freedom
  - Devote ambitions towards other aspect of society life (raising family, hobbies, etc.)
* Over-performing
  - Give the company more value than they extract
  - Are promoted to "clueless" to use as pawns for higher ranking sociopaths


Clueless
---

The clueless are used by sociopaths as pawns in their maneuvers for power and profit
and can act as a buffer for the sociopaths to shield them from risk.

While providing a consistent economic value as an over performing economic loser,
they are valued more highly as part of the clueless by sociopaths as they can
be used as pawns in their maneuvers for power and profit.

\[Rao\] says this succinctly:

> ... \[Sociopaths\] look for ways to systematically claim paternity for successes,
> and orphan failures.

An example given is if a sociopath is leading a potentially highly profitable
strategic gamble (Ribbon Farm uses Ryan's 'line sales channel operation' as the example).
If the gamble pays off, the sociopath is set to receive the reward.

If it becomes clear the gamble is about to fail, the sociopath can promote a person
in the clueless position to take the sociopaths place, thus setting the clueless up
for failure and shielding the sociopath from the fallout that will happen when
the project fails.
The clueless will be grateful for the perceived act of giving them power and, presumably,
will be more likely to take credit for the failure than to shift blame to the sociopath
that initiated the endeavour.

The clueless are giving the perception of power while being denied pathways to the upper
echelons of power (by becoming a "sociopath")

Though \[Rao\] claims that the clueless can't ascend to the sociopath tier,
there's some hints that this might not be so clear cut.
\[Rao\] gives [two examples](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/04/14/the-gervais-principle-iii-the-curse-of-development/#The%20Clueless%20Economy)
of Wallace (the sociopath) coming to talk to Michael (the clueless) because of various
successes or profits.
\[Rao\] discusses these interactions in terms of highlighting how the clueless lack any
currency in power and "The Office" highlights them for comedic effect highlighting the same
lack of power but Wallace, at least in one interaction, starts with powertalk.

The reason from Wallace's powertalk is to start the negotiation with Michael and because
Wallace thought there might be an actual opportunity to exchange power, something that
only a sociopath or aspiring sociopath would be in a position to negotiate for.



Sociopath
---

Sociopaths are at the top of the power pyramid and are the source of power in the company.

The term 'sociopath' itself denotes that the sociopath pursues power
and profit over empathy.

For a successful company, the sociopath needs to delegate both to other sociopaths that have
real power and to subordinates like the clueless to direct the economic losers.

There are different stages of a company and a sociopath at the beginning of a company life cycle
might be more focused on creating a product or filling a societal niche by some 'value-added' aspect
of the business.
Later in a businesses life cycle, it's more profitable to leverage the companies wealth and assets
to mergers, acquisitions, layoffs and other more financial and business strategies that aren't directly
tied to production of value for a society.

This is why the term 'sociopath' is used: sociopaths engage, in all phases of the business life cycle,
exploitative behavior, extracting as much value from employees while giving the bare minimum back.
The implication is that sociopaths add value to society because their pursuit of power and wealth
leads them to create incidental artifacts that benefit society.
Any moral hazard avoided by sociopaths are done because of systems in place to punish bad behavior on
the sociopaths part or because the avoidance of a moral hazard happens to be in line with the pursuit
of profit or power.

In other words, the sociopath has no vested interest in exploiting workers or creating moral hazards,
these just happen to be consequences of their pursuit of power and profit.

A particular tactic that \[Rao\] goes into is called "Hanlon's Dodge".

"Hanlon's Razor" is:

> Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence.

The major tactic that's used is to always have incompetence as a defense, both
for themselves if things go wrong or to point the fingers at subordinates.
By focusing on incompetence, rather than malice, the punishment for failure is lessoned
and cost of failure reduced.

\[Rao\] goes into two major Hanlon dodges:

* Feigned incompetence - the sociopath acts incompetent for an end goal or to reduce punishment
* Execution ambiguity - the sociopath, through vague or indirect language, implies that an agent
  should use unscrupulous means, maintaining plausible deniability and allowing for an accusation
  of incompetence for the person carrying out the deed

To engineer failure, \[Rao\] writes:

> When you genuinely want to give reports responsibilities that help them grow, you give them
> autonomy where they are strong. When you want to use them in engineered “failures” that
> give you the outcomes you want, you give them autonomy in areas where they are weak.

\[Rao\] gives a "Heads I Win, Tails You Lose" name to it: Benefiting from the success while externalizing
the cost of failure.

---

Sociopaths will use a 'divide-and-conquer' approach to manipulate the clueless and
the economic losers.
Though the social hierarchy is encouraged to be ambiguous (see below), the sociopaths
almost surely enforce this behavior to make sure fault lines exist in order to exploit.

If necessary, sociopaths can generate fault lines that can be later exploited (\[Rao\]
gives the example of providing commission incentives to the sales team and not the support team).

Communication
---

The communication is split into four main classifications:

* **Gametalk** : The talk of economic losers among themselves
* **Babytalk** : The talk of the economic losers and sociopaths to the clueless, often placating in nature
* **Posturetalk** : The talk of the clueless to all other layers
* **Powertalk** : The talk of the sociopaths among themselves

Of these, powertalk is the only one that significantly changes dynamics and has consequences.
The requirement of powertalk is to hold actual power.
The purpose of powertalk is to shift power through the exchange of information that is actionable.

For example, an exchange of information between two sociopaths of equal value, or the elaboration
of information at the expense of someone else.

The analogy given in \[Rao\] uses is one of poker: Gametalk, babytalk and posture talk are like a game
of poker with no stakes, powertalk is a game of poker with real money.

Miscellaneous Notes
---

* Status illegibility, the inability to quantify rank, is a necessary ambiguity to
  keep the social dynamic stable ([link](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/10/14/the-gervais-principle-iv-wonderful-human-beings/))
  - By allowing people to think they might be higher tiered, this allows them to operate under a delusion or to ascend
  - A more complete description might be that the rank *can* be quantified but that the cost of examination is
    costly and discouraged so as to keep the farce of ambiguity in place
  - There's probably a parallel to the social taboo of sharing salary and income
  - Almost surely encouraged (or not discouraged) by sociopaths to maintain fertile ground of fault lines to exploit
    for manipulation
* "The Curse of Development", where a slightly more developed individual loses out to the under developed one, comes into play
  with the dynamics of how the economic losers and sociopaths deal with the clueless
  - An example is when your pet coerces you to feed them
  - The development of the clueless is proportional to their rank (re-enforcing the idea that the less developed individual
    gains)
  - Babytalk is used by the economic losers to placate the clueless, effectively making the economic losers
    incur the mental cost of having to manage the situation
  - Babytalk is used by the sociopaths to manipulate the clueless, thus surpassing the threshold the losses incurred by
    the curse of development would incur, presumably of the sociopaths access to power rather than anything intrinsic to the sociopath
    (though there could be an argument that the lack of empathy allows sociopaths to avoid the mental tax of wanting to
    placate the clueless for sympathetic reasons)
  

> This is why, paradoxically, collectivist philosophies that value equality must
> necessarily value diversity. Nobody wants to equally average. Everybody must
> be given a chance to be equally above average.



Ancillary Notes
---

* Media often focuses on the "loser" narrative (in the social sense), whereas
  the clueless narrative (over performing "loser" that still doesn't understand
  how the world works) is what "The Office" explores.
* The "sociopath" narrative is a power fantasy with either a 'complex genius' or
  'power corrupts' narrative
