<p>Not all fits neatly into this structure and there's a lot of variation, including how the subplots weave into
the main hero's journely and adventure (which maybe is why Matrix is so well written).
There might be some disagreement over what the sub plot is (or even if there's just one) and how
it feeds into the reversal.
Also, a lot of the events are not done in order.</p>
<p>It seems like the basic story structure is still valid, though.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this format exactly works with this theme as there's no real inciting event, disaster or despair scenario for Deckard
but there are many aspects that fit.
It should also be noted that Roy Batty could be considered the main character.
It could be considered that the first act of Roy's journey is only eluded to with the rest of the movie being Roy's journey.</p>

<p>It seems that <code>Loss</code> and <code>Disaster</code> go hand in hand so maybe they shouldn't really be differentiated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how well this movie follows the format.
One interpretation is that the horse race is the start of act 2 instead of the ball but
it could be thought of as the horse race being a small sub act 1 stuffed at the end of act 1.
It's also not clear what the reversal is or if it can be cleanly separated.</p>
<p>Maybe it's that there are really two main characters, Henry and Eliza, where Henry's
initial journey is to raise Eliza up and morphs into a fight to keep Eliza whereas
Eliza's journey is to improve her life.</p>

<h3 id="romantic-comedies-city-formula">Romantic Comedies (City Formula)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supporting characters to love interest are not viable options for dating (married, gay, etc.)</li>
<li>External force brings pair to reluctantly work together</li>
<li>Initial refusal of emotional attachment until (usually silent) acceptance that they feel for each other</li>
<li>Conflict happens where usually one party makes a mis-step and drives the love interest apart, often as a direct result
  of the external force that brought them together in the first place putting pressure on them</li>
<li>"Defeat" stage where characters wallow in their loss</li>
<li>"Realization" where the character that made the mis-step comes to their senses, apologizes, makes it right and
  asks for forgiveness</li>
<li>Acceptance where characters end up together</li>
</ul>
