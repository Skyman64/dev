        <h1 id="currency-editorial">Currency Editorial</h1>
<p>These are some opinions I have about currencies, especially as they relate
to cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Currency is, in some very high level aspect, a representation of energy.
The value of currency is a socially contract that everyone who
participates in its use agrees on.
We use currency as a representation of energy to trade for goods or services which
are another form of energy in a different, often more usable, form.</p>
<p>By abstracting the notion of currency, a representational form of energy,
we can exchange money we own for goods or services to a party without the need
to understand what the receiving party will use it for.
While we exchange the representation of energy, the currency, for actual energy,
the representation is not itself energy and is only valid so long as everyone
agrees on its credibility.</p>
<p>As a side note,
this "fungible" feature of currency is often used in a narrative about graduating
from a barter system to one that uses currency but this should viewed with
some skepticism.
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/barter-society-myth/471051/">There is evidence</a> that
the barter economy never really existed and that people more likely used a 'gift economy'.
A gift has difficulty scaling past a certain population size and so a currency is desirable
to facilitate trade.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a list of accepted properties of money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fungibility - the ability to substitute one unit of currency for another</li>
<li>Durability - can be used repeatedly</li>
<li>Divisibility - can be divided into smaller parts</li>
<li>Portability - can be easily transported or carried</li>
<li>Legibility - can be easily identified</li>
<li>Scarcity - supply is limited and is not easily counterfeited</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these aspects allow for money to be used easily and without worry that the system
will collapse from accidental or malicious use.</p>
<h2 id="interest-rates-and-lending">Interest Rates and Lending</h2>
<p>Once currency is understood to be a representation of energy, we can come up with a reason
why interest rates grow exponentially.
I don't have a good understanding of inflation to work out why inflation should occur.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil's_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns">One view</a>
of the technological pace of our civilization is that it grows exponentially.
Technology, in a vague definition, is the conversion of unusable energy to a usable form.
In this sense, our civilization's technological progress can be seen as the conversion
of the energy that would otherwise not be usable by us, mostly coming from the sun, to
a form that we can use.
The form can be calories from food, creation of needed proteins or nutrients or directly
as electricity.
This pace of energy conversion has been growing exponentially for most of recorded history.</p>
<p>This means that any investment in technology today, in whatever form, yields, on average,
exponential returns in the future.
If an investment into a particular technology will yield exponential returns for the recipient
of the loan, the lender can then ask for exponential returns, in the form of some interest
rate, so long as the interest rate works out to be less than the profit that the lendee realizes.</p>
<p>The term 'technology' is used but this could be a business endeavor, a personal loan for education,
farm cultivation, computer manufacture, health, communication or
any host of other engineering, business or scientific pursuits.</p>
<p>I don't have a good understanding of inflation and the mechanisms behind it but here is my best
guess as to what's happening:</p>
<p>Inflation is an engineered situation.
For the US, the target is 2%.
This means, extra money is pumped into the economy so as to devalue the dollar by 2% annually.
This inflation is supposed to drive investment as holding onto money without investing will
decrease its value.</p>
<p>As an argument for why 2% is the specific number chosen for inflation, I would point out that
global energy usage has been growing at a rate of 2%-2.5% per annum since 1980.
The US had a steady energy consumption rate of 2%-2.5% since the 1900s and only started faltering
from that annual growth rate in the late 1970s, presumably because of 1979 oil crisis or some other oil
price shock, from which the US never recovered fully.</p>
<p>So maybe what's going on is that the US government is acting as a lender to the population, be it
directly or through banks, and effectively lending money at a rate of 2% annually.
The idea is that, at least globally, in some gross sense, investments should yield somewhere
in the range of 2%-2.5% annual returns, so lending at 2%, somewhere a bit below the global annual
returns as represented by the energy usage, provides money "lending liquidity" while still
giving adequate return on the investment.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-gold-backed-currency">A Note on Gold Backed Currency</h2>
<p>A quick word about currency that's backed by some other asset, such as gold or some other precious metal
or material.
I will focus on gold but the same argument could just as easily apply to most other materials.</p>
<p>While gold has some particular properties and has some scarcity in the universe because of it's
atomic composition, in some sense the value we imbue gold with is arbitrary.</p>
<p>Gold is a metal that has a particular prevalence on earth.
We could just have easily lived on a planet where gold is as common as water.
Gold's scarcity and difficulty in production allows it to be used as a currency
but insisting that gold be used as an asset backing currency is just one more layer
of indirection trying to obfuscate that any currency's value is a social
contract that is, in any other respect, arbitrary.</p>
<h2 id="locally-we-do-not-exist-in-an-energy-equilibrium">Locally, We Do Not Exist in an Energy Equilibrium</h2>
<p>One point that comes up is the idea that we might be violating some energy conversation laws
by our energy creation or that exponential growth cannot last unfettered.</p>
<p>In response to a violation of the conservation of energy, the answer is that we do not live
in an energy equilibrium.
The sun dumps energy onto the earth in a form that is not easily used by us and is mostly lost by us.
The conversion of this unusable energy to a useable form is what is increasing at an exponential
pace and does not violate any conservation of energy laws.</p>
<p>Our technological pace has been growing exponentially and is most likely going to continue to
grow exponentially for some time.
Unfettered, indefinite, exponential growth cannot continue, if energy is finite, so this exponential
growth will need to halt at some point.</p>
<p>Only a sliver of the sun's energy is deposited on earth, with most being dispersed in all other directions.
Our sun is one many stars and is one of many celestial bodies that we can extract energy from.</p>
<p>Even at a large 2.5% annual increase in energy usage, it would take over 250 years to reach the limits of
the sun's energy being deposited on earth.
Beyond our earth, the stores of energy that are available are galactic.</p>
<h2 id="cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>If people can agree to a crypto-currency's value then it can
be used as a currency.</p>
<p>All money's value is fundamentally arbitrary.
We give a currency it's value by agreeing on how of it to give for a good or service.
If instead of using currency that is arbitrary given value by a government, or a currency
that is arbitrarily given it's value from a physical material, like gold or silver,
then we can use a currency that's given it's value arbitrarily by an agreed on protocol
as is present with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I'm skeptical that anything other than proof-of-work can be made to be a viable decentralized cryptocurrency,
so I'll focus on proof-of-work (PoW) that's used by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The major elements of a currency are satisfied by a cryptocurrency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fungibility - A piece of cryptocurrency is just as valid as any other</li>
<li>Durability - A piece of cryptocurrency can be traded and re-used ad infinitum</li>
<li>Divisibility - A piece of cryptocurrency can be sub-divided as need be</li>
<li>Portability - Cryptocurrency is inherently information and so is easily communicated and thus easily transportable </li>
<li>Legibility - Cryptocurrency can be easily valued and compared as it's just a number</li>
<li>Scarcity - is achieved either by limiting the number of cryptocurrency to ever be produced or by inflating the
  proof of work to match current computational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>A note on divisibility: Bitcoin has a smallest unit of a 'satoshi', just as a United States Dollar has a smallest
unit of a cent (0.01 dollar).
This divisibility seems like a kind of artifact of an older currency discussion and so I'm not sure how
beneficial it is to dive into it.
I will say that cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, are as divisible as all fiat currencies and,
I suspect, have the possibility of a software upgrade to be able to further divide the 'satoshi' if need be.</p>
<p>Scarcity also warrants a bit more discussion.
Bitcoin's proof of work mechanism allows for an ever intensifying work mechanism to make sure
that the mining of new Bitcoin and, eventually, steady-state economic transfer and transaction of Bitcoin,
will dynamically scale to the available resources.
The incentive structure ensures that if there is cheaper compute to gain an advantage, people will
use it and there will be a race for who can use the cheapest compute to gain the reward in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin uses two scarcity mechanism, one that limits the amount of actual Bitcoin produced (around 21M BTC)
and the other as a scaled proof of work mechanism.</p>
<p>I'm unclear as to the advantages and disadvantages of a finite number of Bitcoin.
One advantage of the finite number of Bitcoin is that it's easy to reason about, since the number itself is capped.</p>
<p>As I see it, possible disadvantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note dealing with inflation well, as a satoshi might need to be further subdivided to account for large scale
  inflation</li>
<li>Uncapping the amount of cryptocurrency might lead to a less volatile currency as fluctuations can be absorbed
  by creating more cryptocurrency that wouldn't be possible with a fixed number of potential coins</li>
</ul>
<p>One could imagine a cryptocurrency that yields mined coins on a decreasing power law scale, potentially
making the number of theoretical coins infinite while still giving fewer coins as the cryptocurrency
matures.
Anyway, I have to profess ignorance.</p>
<h3 id="addendum-a-note-on-the-wealthy">Addendum: A Note on the Wealthy</h3>
<p>One idea is that wealthy individuals are wardens of money rather than owners.
The social contract is that people give an individual their money as payment for
goods and services but also with the hope that they will use that money for other,
potentially societally beneficial, endeavours.</p>
<p>If an individual that is a warden of wealth does not use their surplus of money
better than how the public trust can, then the wealth should be transferred from
the individual to the public trust.</p>
<p>There will always be a tension between what is good for society and what is good for
the individual.
Wealth is a form of power and disproportionate power can warp policy to create more difficulty
in separating the wealth from the wealthy individual.
There will always be a battle between individuals who want to accumulate wealth that is better served under the direction
of the public trust and the public.</p>
<p>Disproportionate wealth is not inherently bad just as system of completely flat, equal wealth is not inherently
good.
The question is what distribution of wealth should we see in a healthy economy or system of government.</p>
<p>My opinion is that some wealth aggregation is functionally better for society than insisting a completely flat
distribution.
We see this with elected officials who wield a disproportionate amount of power.
There are limits to terms of officials and limits to their power, but the reason they are allowed
an aggregation of power is to enact the public will they've been elected for.</p>
<p>So too can this be with wealth.</p>
