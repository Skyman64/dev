Each scene should have (at least one of) the character(s) change from `mad, sad, glad, scared`
to another.

Protagonist has to choose journey rather than having something to them.

Define `hero goal sequence` as a 2-7 minute section where the protagonist pursues a single, physical
short term goal as a single step to achieve overall story goal. After which the protagonist discovers
something that puts an end to the current pursuit and offers a new single, physical short term goal.

* Act I: 6 "hero goal sequences" 
  - 6th "hero goal sequence" is "stunning surprise" and starts Act II
* Act II: 12 "hero goal sequences"
  - First part of Act II contains 6 "hero goal sequences"
  - 6th "hero goal sequence" contains the midpoint sequence
  - Second part of Act II contains 6 "hero goal sequences"
  - 12th "hero goal sequences" contains "stunning surprise 2"
* Act III: 2-5 "hero goal sequences"
  - 3 is average
  - 5 is often too long

"Standard" is 21 "hero goal sequences".

* Stunning surprise 1 should:
  - only happen to the hero
  - be a sudden event or realization
  - come as a genuine shock to the hero
  - fundamentally changes the hero's circumstances
  - change the hero's destiny
  - is the movies "action-line"
* Midpoint (halfway through act II) often has:
  - point of no return
  - fight becomes personal to hero
  - first kiss (romantic), realized respect (buddy movie)
  - unmasking
  - hero often "chooses" to continue/personal growth
  - if "ticking clock" exists, starts at midpoint
  - death/rebirth
* Stunning surprise 2:
  - end of act II
  - all same requirements of stunning surprise 1 but with a "twist"
  - destroys hero's plans (laid plans from end of act I to end of act II)
  - "darkest hour" (before dawn)
* Obligatory scene
  - resolves overarching conflict (climactic fight)
* Unwinding
  - space to process and look back at what's transpired

Stunning surprise (or revelation) need not be directly related to the inciting incident,
the adversary or the main conflict but provides an undercurrent of why the inciting incident,
adversary or main conflict is being pursued.
The stunning surprise needs to be the main driving force for action throughout the narrative
but the event itself need not be directly related to why the conflict is happening in the first place.

For example:

* stunning surprise for "Spider Man" is Ben's death (and subsequent motivation of "with great power comes
  great responsibility") even though the inciting incident is the gain of power and an adversary that's
  ascending (power is unrelated to Ben's death, green goblin ascending is unrelated to power but using the
  power to pursue conflict with green goblin is because spider man was shaped by the stunning surprise)
* stunning surprise for "Total Recall" is that Doug might be a secret agent, which is directly tied
  to the inciting incident, adversary, etc.
* stunning surprise for "John Carter of Mars" is that he's transported to Mars, again directly linking
  the stunning surprise to the adversary, main conflict, etc.

Misc
---

* Have an active protagonist that participates and makes choices about their fate instead of having things just
  happen to them.
* Make a protagonist that has clear visible goals
* (Maybe only for comedies) have protagonist have learning moments where initial goal changes
* Each minute should have ticking clocks, realising stakes, good news / bad news
* Need peaks and valleys of intensity
* Protagonist should have flaws, should have sympathy for antagonist
